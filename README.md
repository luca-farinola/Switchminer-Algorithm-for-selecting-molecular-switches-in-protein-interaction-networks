<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

RNA sequencing data are used to construct protein correlation network and select nodes with interesting mathematical property (and therefore of biological interest) 
we have downloaded and edited for our pourpose the code from the following github repo : 

Bird eye view of the project:
* Differential expression analysis with limma 
* Co-epression  Network
* Switch Miner algorithm
  
Switch Miner algorithm is described in the following article : 

<!-- DATA -->
### Data

Data directory is needed to run the files. Those data include gene expression count data, 
metadata with patient information, gene lenght. Those data are uploaded in zenodo at link below.
